## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a **software developer** and **42 Porto student**, driven by curiosity and a passion for building optimized, maintainable solutions.  
I love understanding how things work under the hood and enjoy the full development cycle â€” from gathering requirements and designing solutions to delivering clean, efficient code.
Highly motivated by challenges and eager to keep learning.

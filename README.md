# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Vieira

Iâ€™m a software developer and 42 Porto student, driven by curiosity and a passion for building optimized, maintainable solutions.  
I love understanding how things work under the hood and enjoy the full development cycle â€” from gathering requirements and designing solutions to delivering clean, efficient code.
Highly motivated by challenges and eager to keep learning.
